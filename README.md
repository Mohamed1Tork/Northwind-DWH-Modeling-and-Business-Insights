# Data Ingestion
## Overview
This directory contains scripts and resources dedicated to the crucial task of ingesting data into tables within our data warehouse. Data ingestion is fundamental for ensuring that our data warehouse is populated with relevant information, enabling effective analysis and informed decision-making.

## Files
Each SQL file in this directory corresponds to a specific table within the data warehouse. These files contain the necessary SQL commands to ingest data into their respective tables.

## Usage
To execute the data ingestion process:

1. Ensure that the scripts in the DWH Implementation directory have been successfully implemented to set up the data warehouse structure.
2. Execute the SQL scripts in this directory to ingest data into the corresponding tables within the data warehouse.
