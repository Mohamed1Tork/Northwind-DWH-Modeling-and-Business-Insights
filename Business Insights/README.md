# Business Insights
This section presents the final insights derived from the queries to meet the business requirements.

## 1. Churn Rate
Our initial aim was to segment customers to understand their behavior towards our business. By applying the RFM Model, we identified customers with low recency and high frequency, enabling us to focus on understanding their churn rate and devising strategies for re-engagement.

## 5. Returns Analysis
This analysis aims to segment order return causes. By identifying the main reasons for returns, we can compare the frequency of each cause against suppliers, shippers, and customers. Higher returns for a specific shipper may indicate underlying issues.

## 6. Customer Maturity Analysis
This analysis compares customers based on their business size, i.e., their potential versus actual purchasing behavior. Identifying under-purchasing customers enables us to provide them with more attention as they have the potential to significantly benefit our business.

## 7. Proactive Customer Engagement
Analyzing time-patterns for each customer allows us to identify their purchasing habits and take proactive steps to engage with them, providing assistance or offering relevant products/services. This approach is crucial for building trust and loyalty.
